        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Detail-oriented and versatile professional with a strong background in office administration, sales, and logistics. Throughout my career, I’ve developed expertise in sales tracking, invoice management, and the creation of commercial proposals, always striving to improve operational efficiency and maintain high standards of accuracy and organization.
          <br>
          <br>
        In addition to my administrative experience, I have a solid foundation in digital marketing and brand promotion. I'm skilled in managing online campaigns, social media advertising, and visual content development. Proficient in Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite, I bring both analytical and creative thinking to the projects I work on.
        <br>
        <br>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Industrial and Product Design, which has given me a strategic perspective on product identification, inventory management, and customer experience. I am also certified in digital marketing and have gained hands-on experience in branding, audience engagement, and multichannel marketing strategies.
        <br>
        <br>Fluent in both English and Spanish, with basic proficiency in Mandarin Chinese, I thrive in multicultural environments and collaborative settings. I’m adaptable, proactive, and continuously driven to learn, improve, and contribute meaningfully to the teams and projects I’m part of.
